# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Permission Pilot".

## Preamble

"Permission Pilot" has no internet permission and does not share user data with 3rd parties. 

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Installed application information

Permission Pilot requires the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission to access and display information about installed
applications and their permissions. Information about installed apps is processed locally. Permission Pilot has no
internet permission and does not upload data to 3rd parties. Note: Information about installed apps may also be
contained in manually generated [debug logs](#debug-log).

## Debug log

This is not available in the Google Play variant of Permission Pilot.
The FOSS build variant of Permission Pilot has debug functionality that can be used to assist troubleshooting efforts. It is manually triggered by the user through an option in the app settings. This feature creates a log file that contains verbose output of what the app is doing. The recorded log file can be shared with compatible apps (e.g. your email app) through the system's share dialog. As this log file may contain sensitive information (e.g. your installed applications) it should only be shared with trusted parties.![DebugAnywhere-screenshot-1683445148150](https://github.com/charlykt/permission-pilot/assets/133184193/8564406d-3247-4c92-a96f-fdb9d0dc73a5)
